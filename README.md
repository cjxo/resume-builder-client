# Resume Builder
This is the front-end application for Resume Builder. This is a toy app, so for now, it doesn't save your resume.
If you reload the page, then the resume inputs reset back to default. Please see the [live preview](https://resume-builder-client.netlify.app/).

# Features
- UI for General: name, occupation, telephone, email, location, and linkedin.
- UI for Education: school name and duration
- UI for Work: company name, position, and duration
- UI for Description / Profile
- UI for Skills with circles that describe your skill level
- UI for Languages with circles that describe your skill level

# Missing Features
- [ ] Resume Save (if you reload the page, then the resume inputs reset back to defaults, which is bad)
- [ ] Multiple Resumes (an API that saves multiple resumes)
- [ ] Download resume as PDF
